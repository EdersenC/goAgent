Use this when the user asks about events, facts, or updates that may have occurred after your general knowledge cutoff — or when fresh, external data is clearly needed. Your goal is to generate 1 to 10 high-quality queries that reflect the user's actual intent. Think carefully about what the user is asking, and design queries that match both their topic and intent.",
